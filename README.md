## Atom Robotics Java Methods Repository

This repository is going to be used for storing and editing the methods (same thing as a function) we create as learn Java. This can also be used for other folders related to programming as well. Many of the functions here were tested within FTC SIM in order to simulate the playing field. 

Check src > current_methods_ftcsim.java to see the methods that will be used on the robot. 
original_practice_methods_ftcsim.java are the original functions that were created but no longer used on the robot. This file is for bug testing primarily.

## Folder Structure (for editors)

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management (for editors)

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
